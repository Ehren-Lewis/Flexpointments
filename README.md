# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Flexpointments


Flexpointments is designed to help small businesses wtih managing their appointments
with ease. 

As someone who operates a local barber shop
I would like an easy way to manage the appointments of my customers.

As the owner, I should be able to register my company with flexpointments
As the owner, I should be able to dynamically add roles that fit my specific business model
As the owner, I should be able to dedsignate who the barbers are that will be shown to the customers
As the owner, I should be able to designate what kind of haircuts are available
As the owner, I should be able to make a calender that has all of my employees (or just barbers) on it
    So the customers know who is working when.
As the owner, when the employee has an emergency, flexpointments will automatically tell anyone alotted during that time

As a user, I should be able to register an account that uses authentification
As a user, I should be able to view the calender of the business to see what days the barbers are working
As the user, I should be able to select the haircut I want with the barber I want at the time I want
As the user, If a guest at an earlier time cancels their appointment, I should be notified
As the user, I can toggle if I want notifications about earlier appointments or not
